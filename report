I ended up using the format the instructor had given because it helped me understand how the code worked and was able to use it as a guide
I made sure to keep the Arrays and HashMap Methods in the App file
I then imported the files for methods, files and packages used in each java page
I added subclasses for each animal with their own unique features but wasn't sure how to join it with the App file
I then made a new text file report in newAnimals with its count at the bottom
In the end I made sure the code was working and it did. I hope to make more changes and implement more efficient codes in showing my understanding of this assignment
